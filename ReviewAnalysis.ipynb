My only gripe was trying to find this place...despite having been in the Venetian so many times, it was still quite an effort to find it! My tip would be to enter from the OUTSIDE, when you're by the main Venetian entrance by Tao (and the annoying time share people lol) overlooking the courtyard and bridges keep walking down the walkway and it'll be right by the entrance. If you're coming from inside, good luck...it can be a maze navigating the multiple levels and Grand Canal Shops lolOverall - I would come back! The food was delicious.

With their great food and chill ambiance, it was a favorite place to get away from the hustle and bustle. They made some amazing vegetable mushroom frittatas with creme fraiche that were outstanding. The seating is great, with lots of different areas for us to spread out in different groups. It's located on the 2nd floor of the Venetian. After passing Madame Tussaud's on the way up to the Grand Canal shoppes, don't go in the main door from the outside, keep going and you'll reach an easy entrance to Buddy V's.

Others at my booth liked their bone-in Veal Parmesan Alfredo, Veal Piccata, and Nonna's 7 Layer Lasagna.  Garlic Spinach was a welcome, somewhat unusual side. My son was given a complimentary birthday dessert, and service was stellar all night, with Iced Tea refills served without the need for a request.   Our principal server Joana was very knowledgeable about the various menu offerings and accommodating.  The restaurant was packed with diners the whole time we were there.  But we were seated immediately at our reservation time and never rushed during the 2-1/2 hour meal.  Courses arrived nicely spaced out.  The music from the bar was somewhat loud but the ambiance was elegant and classy.  Diane and I will most definitely return here, for we have liked every entree we have tried in repeat visits.\",\n",

We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the cheese raviolis. The waiter asked us if we wanted bread and we said sure. Beware, it is not the typical bread that comes on the table. It's really good, but it is an additional charge for $12. The food was so good. We really enjoyed sitting there and watching the kitchen, taking in the ambience. The lights were really cool. We ordered cheesecake and the bananas foster for dessert. The cheesecake was probably the best I have been ever had. The bananas foster was ok- I didn't like the texture of the cake. I would definitely come back.\",\n",

It was still a bit busy, but we were seated right away.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful in answering our questions.  We started off with the Cheesy Garlic Bread, and it was a delicious amount of cheese and garlic.  I got the Pepino Alto to drink and my bf got the Limonata.  The cocktails were very tasty.  I ordered the My Mother in Law's Linguine Shrimp Scampi and my bf ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp.  The pastas were very good and flavorful, and the shrimp was cooked well.\",\n",

       "  'Review Text': \"When planning my 40th birthday party, I started with reserving a table for my birthday dinner! I was happy to work with the events team (Emily and Brittany). They helped me get a menu for a family style dinner and created a contract for us so that we had a table for 14 set up and ready for us! The communication before the event was all done by email and was easy to do. On the day of the event, we all arrived and had a bit of a wait. When the table was ready, we were walked back to the dining room and started with our service. My only negative experience was that the way our server was helping us with drinks, he was trying to do uncharging rather than just sticking with our hour open bar drinks. He was also pushing the sparkling water and Fiji water which (to my mistake) I agreed to have them at the table not knowing that this was going to be a major uncharge. I guess I was just confused because he made it sound like the water was included in the service, so I agreed. But I should have questioned it a bit more. I knew that the wine we were going to have with dinner would be an uncharge, but the water was a joke. I really should have just said we would all drink tap water because once we got the bill for the waters I was shocked! But by then, it was too late to say anything. The drink service took a while and since we had an hour of the open bar, I was worried that we would not be able to order too many drinks per person since the time it took to get drinks was taking a while so as soon as we got our drinks, I went ahead and asked for another round and then another. I wanted us to each get at least 3-4 drinks per person for the price we were paying. Our menu was pre-selected so we started with salad and meatballs. Honestly, the best part of the salad were the croutons! They were soft and had a lemon zest flavor-they were so good! Since I don't eat the meatballs, I have to rely on my friends for their feedback and they all said they were delicious. In fact, I am pretty sure all the meatballs were eaten and nothing was left behind. The dinner portion included spinach and artichoke Alfredo and the spaghetti bolognese. I loved the creamy Alfredo flavor and I could tell that the others at the table enjoyed the spaghetti because once again, the food was all consumed. For dessert, I was very happy that they provided me a very special slice of their pumpkin cheesecake for my 40th birthday and then we had ordered cannoli's and tiramisu for the table. Everything was enjoyed and by the end of the dinner, we were all stuffed. When it was time to pay the tab, I was a bit price shocked with all the extra charges (mainly the water), but again, I should have asked about this being an uncharge from the beginning. I just didn't think to since it sounded like it was part of the package. The wine was also expensive, but I agreed to the bottles so that's on me. Was this a great meal and experience? Absolutely! But would I do it different next time? Yes. The food was great and the atmosphere was so perfect for the group. Everyone seemed happy and all my friends were very excited to give this place a try! I know I was so happy to eat at Buddy V's and will be back again next time.\",\n",

       "  'Review Text': \"Our first stop was at the bar before our reservation.    The bartender was friendly and I had a glass of the Chianti.   The pour was nice, but it wasn't my favorite glass of wine. We checked in with the hostess and she offered us a choice of tables and we chose the window view.    It was in the bar area, but was nice and quiet.  The menu has a nice variety of appetizers, pasta dishes, and meat dishes.    Our server was friendly and took our drink order.   I switched to the Pinot Noir which was a better choice.   They brought us a plate with 2 pieces of focaccia bread and then a dish with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.    The bread was good.  I settled on a bowl of tomato bisque and the rigatoni bolognese.    My husband asked about the Sunday Gravy dish and when she described it, it sounded huge so I asked if it was something that could be shared.   I ended up not getting the bolognese and sharing his meal.The soup arrived timely and was nice and hot.    Flavor was good and the croutons added a nice crunch.  I had time to enjoy it before they brought our meal, which I highly appreciated.  The entree was rigatoni with meatballs, sausage, pork and lamb.   There was no way my husband could  have eaten that by himself.    They were kinda enough to give each of us a bowl with rigatoni and then the platter of meat.  First, the sauce was so good I could have just eaten that with bread.   The meatball and sausage were excellent.   Each had a little bit of heat which I enjoyed.    I am not a huge pork or lamb person so I only ate a little of the pork and it was tender as could be.    We had asked for more bread, but that never came.    I would have loved to sop up more sauce.    We hadn't seen the server in a long time, and she never checked to see how we liked the meal.   Overall, very good meal.\",\n",

I also don't recommend it to people who eat meat but don't eat pork since majority of their meat is pork.

Walking into the restaurant you can clearly see the New York/ Italian inspiration with the red and white checkered table settings, rolling pin decor (a nod to the Cake Boss) and cans of tomatoes adorning the shelves above the bar.  The menu offers alot of options and all look amazing however, I could not pass the massive red print in the middle of the menu that screams \"Valstro Sunday Gravy\".  At the hearty price of $35 I went ahead and ordered it hoping the dish would be as heart as the price - and it was.  This dish was busting with character with tons of meats, perfectly prepared pasta and the sauce, it was amazing.  It was so good I could not stop eating.',\n",

       "  'Review Text': \"We had the prix fixe menu option since we were set to also watch the Spiegelworld Atomic Saloon Show afterwards. We were promptly seated and given the menu options, which were amazing choices.  I opted for the Caesar Salad, Foccaccia bread and olive oil/balsamic dipping sauce, Chicken Piccata, and Tiramisu.  I also got a Welcome Atomic Cocktail.First off, the staff was pretty conscientious of our time between dinner and the show and prepared all of our items (8 in our party) quickly and accurately.The drink was a nice, refreshing take on a makeshift Aperol Spritz and had the perfect balance of flavorful, pretty, tasty, and tart.The Caesar salad was crisp and flavorful--I am usually paranoid about the lettuce swimming in salad dressing, but not the case here.My Chicken Piccata complete with capers, linguine, garlic, and lemon was delicious and melted in my mouth.  Unfortunately, at this point I had to conserve stomach space so that I could at least try some dessert.The Tiramisu was to die for! The ladyfingers were nice and crunchy and went well with the rest of the dessert.  I was kinda bummed that I didn't know that the cheesecake option was a seasonal pumpkin one, otherwise I probably would've tried it out.  My dessert went well with the Cappuccino that I had to order to stay awake.It was a nice venue with the right volume of music so that it wasn't too loud to have people yelling at each other to be heard over the sounds of music.  I also liked the holiday decor.  It made the venue that much more inviting.The staff was so attentive with refilling waters, drinks, and boxing up my food to go. Given the amount of food ordered and how busy the venue was for our dinnertime, the staff made sure that we had a great experience and got out of there with plenty of time to spare.I cannot rave about this place enough.  I will definitely come back and enjoy when it is less busy with events and I have more time to sit back and relax without running to a show afterwards.\",\n",

I ordered the lasagna which seemed kind of bland. The meat sauce had little flavor which was surprising.  Our appetizer I should say was the eggplant parmesan and it was good.  That had more taste then the lasagna.We kept having to ask for refills on water and bread.Our server just was not good at all, she rarely came around and just didn't seem like she really wanted to be there.I recommend you give this place a try and leave your review but based on the service and the just ok food, I can get better food off the strip.\",\n",

After you get your food, they come around and offer pepper flakes/parmesan cheese for your food. One thing I thought was odd was that our food took very long to come out. I'd say it was almost a 30 minute wait for our food and we noticed a table that came after us got theirs first. I would like to point out how good of a deal their lunch specials are. You get to pick an appetizer, entree, and dessert for only $30. If you want to have solid Italian food, I'd say this place does the job well in a great setting.Complimentary Bread: Very nice texture of bread and tasted amazing with the balsamic vinegar olive oil mixture.Caesar Salad: Super fresh lettuce and the croutons are not your ordinary croutons. They have a crispy outer shell and the inside is soft and creamy. Very good salad!Tomato and Basil Soup: I can tell the tomatoes are very fresh here because the taste of tomato was really strong. The soup was a bit sour for my taste, but it was decent.Spaghetti and Meatballs: As I mentioned before, the tomatoes are really fresh which kind of made my spaghetti sauce a bit sour, but I really liked this dish. The meatballs were a good size and presentation was beautiful. A nice solid authentic Italian spaghetti.Grill Salmon: Wow the salmon was so juicy. I think this is the healthier alternative on the lunch special menu because besides the salmon, there wasn't really much else besides the veggies on the bottom. I really liked the salmon here.Pepperoni Pizza: Solid pizza, but a bit too oily for me. I enjoyed the crust and the cheese on this pizza, which was prepared nicely. The pepperonis are cup shaped which catches all the oil in it, which pops in your mouth when you bite it. Cannoli: This was my first ever cannoli and wow I want more. One side had chocolate chips while the other side had pistachio on it. The dessert was crunchy on the outside and the cream was not too sweet on the inside. I can eat a million of these if I wanted to.New Jersey Style Cheesecake: This cheesecake was really good. I loved how it wasn't too sweet or cheesy with the right balance of both. The strawberry jam added a punch of flavor that tasted really good. The bottom crust is not too hard and not too soft, so overall this might be the perfect cheesecake.\",\n",

The table clothes and cloth napkins make for a very Italian atmosphere  and it is very comfortable whether it be for a fancy dinner or for just a simple family gathering. Some were dressed very casually and others were dressed very dressy. We try and go here at least once a year as there are several great Italian places to eat here in Las Vegas.\",\n",
